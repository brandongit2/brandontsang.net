				My first web development job was at{` `}

				, which was part <Bg>consulting</Bg> company, part
				{` `}
				<Bg>developer-mentoring</Bg> company. My React familiarity paid off there as I was part of the company&apos;s
				Discord server where I answered tons of questions from entry-level developers, and I helped organize community
				coding events. In fact, I got the job in the first place participating in one of these events, where the founder
				noticed my work and reached out to me. He has since served as a helpful mentor and a friend.

				I then worked at{` `}

				, a <Bg>property management SaaS</Bg> company. There, I worked as part of the marketing team as opposed to the
				primary development team. I gave the very small marketing team representation in the site they hadn&apos;t had
				before, and I contributed some of my design experience as well. In addition to these, I helped integrate the
				company&apos;s existing marketing site with{` `}
				<a href="https://www.builder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="underline">
					Builder.io
				</a>
				, and I began work on a marketing platform to reduce dependence on Zapier and CMSes. It was built on top of the
				extensive data the company had collected since its existence, and would be a major upgrade in the marketing
				workflow, which was up to then very bootstrapped. I had some great experiences at this company, and they have a
				great culture, but it was my first &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; experience. From then on I learned that I wasn&apos;t
				the corporate type; I much prefer to work at smaller, indie-feeling companies.
