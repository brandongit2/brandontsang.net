								I made my first website when I was <span className="font-semibold">13</span>; I had to make a slideshow
								for a school presentation and I wanted to make it look really special. I went all out with transitions
								and interactivity, played with GSAP{` `}
								<span className="text-sm opacity-50">(a JavaScript animation library)</span>, and hardcoded everything
								in a set of HTML files. It was glorious for its time. And probably no one at school cared, but I
								don&apos;t care that no one cared, because I did it for myself, and sometimes that&apos;s all you need
								to keep going.

								Later on when I was 17, I got hooked on{` `}
								<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="underline">
									Khan Academy
								</a>
								{` `}
								(a strange thing to get hooked on, I&apos;m sure) and decided I wanted to make my own version of it,
								with a strong emphasis on interactive articles. I also wanted to make a graphing calculator to generate
								really slick-looking visuals. And <Bg>this was how I learned React</Bg>. I honestly didn&apos;t even
								know what it was at the time, I just wanted to be able to re-use my HTML in component form. Anyway of
								course, my plans were too ambitious and the project never materialized. But I{` `}

										For the past few years, I&apos;ve been divided on whether to delve further into backend work, or

										<span className="font-semibold">

										want to work with others who are as passionate and dedicated as I am, and I want to work on projects
										which push the limits of what I&apos;m capable of.
									</p>
									<p>
										I particularly want to work with <Bg>Swift/SwiftUI</Bg> and <Bg>Metal</Bg>, because it&apos;s my
