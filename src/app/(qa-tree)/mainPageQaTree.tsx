								I made my first website when I was <span className="font-semibold">13</span>; I had to make a slideshow
								for a school presentation and I wanted to make it look really special. I went all out with transitions
								and interactivity, played with GSAP{` `}
								<span className="text-sm opacity-50">(a JavaScript animation library)</span>, and hardcoded everything
								in a set of HTML files. It was glorious for its time.
							</p>

								Later on when I was 17, I got hooked on{` `}
								<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="underline">
									Khan Academy
								</a>
								{` `}
								(a strange thing to get hooked on, I&apos;m sure) and decided I wanted to make my own version of it,
								with a strong emphasis on interactive articles. I also wanted to make a graphing calculator to generate
								really slick-looking visuals. And <Bg>this was how I learned React</Bg>. I honestly didn&apos;t even
								know what it was at the time, I just wanted to be able to re-use my HTML in component form. Anyway of
								course, my plans were too ambitious and the project never materialized. But I{` `}
								<Under>learned a ton</Under> about modern web development, including{` `}
								<Bold>bundling</Bold>,{` `}
								<Bold>my first framework</Bold>, and even{` `}
								<Bold>user auth</Bold>
								{` `}
								and{` `}
								<Bold>how to use a database</Bold>. Take it from me, being overly ambitious is the number one way to get
								really good at something.

										For the past few years, I&apos;ve been divided on whether to delve further into back-end work, or
										specialize in front-end for good. That decision is clear as day to me now:{` `}
										<span className="font-semibold">
											<Under>front-end is where I belong</Under>
										</span>
										. I want to keep doing what I&apos;m currently doing, and also expand my skillset by entering{` `}
										<Bg>WebGL development</Bg>, <Bg>graphics programming</Bg>, and <Bg>native mobile development</Bg>. I
										want to work with others who are as passionate and dedicated as I am, and I want to work on projects
										which push the limits of what I&apos;m capable of.
									</p>
									<p>
										I particularly want to work with <Bg>Swift/SwiftUI</Bg> and <Bg>Metal</Bg>, because it&apos;s my
										impression that they have great developer experience, and it sounds very nice to not have to work
										with CSS for a bit.
