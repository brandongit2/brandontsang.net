									React has been my go-to since day one. For the <Bg>nearly five years</Bg> I&apos;ve been using it,
									there has never been a time when I tried to do something it wasn&apos;t capable of. This is thanks in
									large part to the{` `}
									<strong className="font-semibold">extensive ecosystem</strong> of libraries built around it. I think
									that one of the big reasons React has been around so{` `}
									<span className="opacity-50">(comparatively)</span> long is that the ecosystem allows the entire
									development community as a whole to determine{` `}
									<em>what React is</em>. By picking and choosing different libraries to use with React over time, React
									can stay the exact same, but{` `}
									<Under>how we use it is able to evolve with our ever-changing needs.</Under>
								</p>
								<p>
									And now with the introduction of <Bg>React Server Components</Bg>, React is making another huge leap.
									We took advantage of Server Components with Next.js&nbsp;13 in SprintZero, and the experience was
									amazing. Although we didn&apos;t do much data fetching ourselves because of Cloud Firestore, giving
									some components direct access to the back-end&mdash;not to mention allowing them to be{` `}
									<Cde>async</Cde>

									Last but not least, probably my favourite library of all time.{` `}
									<strong className="font-semibold">Framer Motion</strong> is a React animation library that practically
									enables <Bg>real-life magic</Bg>.{` `}
									<strong className="font-semibold">Layout animations</strong> enable elements to{` `}
									<em>automatically</em>&nbsp;ðŸ§™ animate their position when the CSS layout changes; components can
									{` `}
									<Under>maintain their identity</Under>
									{` `}
									and animate between <Under>completely separate parts</Under> of the DOM; you can define{` `}
									<Under>your own animating values</Under>
									{` `}
									<span className="opacity-50">(as plain numbers and even interpolated CSS strings!!!)</span>
									{` `}
									and imperatively animate them... It&apos;s hard to explain the amount of flexibility and power this
									library affords me as an animation-hungry web developer.
								</p>
								<p>
									And of course, this library was used substantially throughout SprintZero, in parts{` `}
									<Bg>enabling actual functionality</Bg> that was crucial to the app&apos;s workflow.
